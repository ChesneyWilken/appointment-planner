# Appointment Planner

This is a simple appointment planner built using React. It was completed as part of the CodeCademy Full-Stack developer course. You can find the deployed version of the app [here](https://react-appointmet-planner.netlify.app)

## Purpose

The comments in this project serve two main purposes. The first is to serve as a detailed reminder to me when I need a refresher on React and how props are passed. The second is to provide a detailed explanation of what each part of the code does, why I've implemented it that way, and some of the mistakes I made while writing the code.

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to have React installed. If you do not have React installed, you can install it by running npm install react in the command line.

Once you have React installed, simply clone the repository and run npm start in the command line. The app will then be available at localhost:3000.

For more information on React you can visit the React website https://react.dev/learn

## Feedback

This repository will be posted publicly for my peers to use. Feedback and questions are welcome if anyone thinks I have missed something.
